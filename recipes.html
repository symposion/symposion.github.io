                            Avocado-banana breakfast smoothie
                            Serves 2

                            1 ripe avocado
                            1 ripe banana
                            1 tbsp live bio yogurt
                            2 tbsp seed mix (Infinity Wholefoods' four seed omega mix is great)
                            1 tbsp peanut butter (homemade is best, click here for recipe)
                            Water
                            Salt (I use a good pinch)

                            Optional
                            Honey (add once blended if you like it sweet)

                            Make it vegan
                            Replace dairy yogurt with vegan yogurt (made with coconut or soy milk)
                            For sweetening use maple or agave syrup

                            Put everything apart from the water and honey/maple/agave (if using) in the blender. Add water to just cover all the ingredients and blend until smooth.

                            Pour into two glasses and and honey/maple/agave to taste by swirling it through.

                            Vegan Chocolate Hazelnut Cheesecake
                            Makes a 9"round cake

                            For the crust
                            1 cup finely ground mixed nuts
                            ¼ cup + 2 Tablespoons raw cocoa powder
                            3 tbsp honey
                            1 tsp vanilla extract
                            1 pinch sea salt

                            Blend all ingredients together in a food processor until it starts to come together. Press the crust into the bottom of desired pan, about ¼ inch thick. Set aside while you make the filling.

                            For the filling
                            2 cups raw mixed nuts, soaked and rinsed
                            ¼ cup + 2 tbsp peanut or hazelnut butter (recipe for homemade here)
                            1 cup raw cocoa powder
                            ½ cup coconut oil, melted
                            ½ cup water
                            2-3 tbsp honey (to taste)
                            1 teaspoon salt

                            Make it vegan
                            Replace the honey with maple or agave syrup

                            In a food processor or mixer blend together nuts, honey/maple/agave, water and salt. Mix until totally smooth, scraping down the sides of the processor as necessary. Add cocoa powder, peanut/hazelnut butter and coconut oil to the but mixture and blend them all together, scraping down again, until mixture is completely combined.
                            Spoon or pipe the filling on top of the crust. Stick the cheesecake in the freezer until solid all the way through (at least 2 hours for individual cheesecakes, 4 for a large cheesecake).

                            Once frozen, remove the cheesecake from the pan. If using a silicone mold they will easily pop out. If you have a metal tin, run a sharp, hot knife around the edges of the cheesecake, flip the tin upside down and give it a few good whacks against the counter. It should start to slowly slide out at this point. Be patient, gravity is on your side. If a few minutes have passed and the cheesecake is still refusing to drop, use a lighter to heat the bottom of the tin briefly; the heat will help release the cake. Place the cheesecakes in the refrigerator and decorate with berries and mint leaves just before serving.

                            Granola
                            Makes enough for two people for approximately one week

                            This recipe is adapted from the lovely Rachel Brathen's "Granola for superheroes and mermaids"

                            You will need:

                            Oats
                            Mixed nuts (Infinity Wholefoods)
                            Mixed seeds (Infinity Wholefoods four seed omega mix)
                            Shredded/desiccated coconut
                            Chia seeds (a few tablespoons)
                            Figs
                            Apricots
                            Coconut oil
                            Honey
                            Sea salt

                            Use a cup of each oats and mixed nuts and half a cup of everything else (except the chia seeds). For this quantity add about two tablespoons of coconut oil and one-two tablespoons of honey/maple/agave (less or more depending on how sweet you want it) and a dash of the sea salt.

                            Put everything in a large baking pan and mix it all together, I find using my hands works best and previously melting the coconut oil is helpful too. You want it nice and gooey but don’t overdo the coconut oil. Put it in the oven at 160°c, bake for 45 mins mixing every 10-15 mins as you don't want it to burn on the top.

                            Meanwhile, chop up the apricots and figs so they’re in smaller pieces - scissors work well for this as it's a sticky job. Add these to the granola mix and bake for another 10-15 until it’s golden and your kitchen smells really nice. Take out and enjoy!

                            Simple but very tasty salad dressing
                            Makes enough for a big salad for two

                            1 clove of garlic, crushed
                            1 tsp mustard
                            1 tsp balsamic vinegar
                            Honey
                            Olive oil

                            Mix everything together apart from the oil, using a small whisk or teaspoon (with a teaspoon it takes a bit longer) start to add very small quantities of oil. Make sure the it's completely emulsified by mixing fast and well before adding more oil. Add until the mixture looks creamy. Taste and add more of anything you like, according to your taste.

                            This is a fun recipe to experiment with, try using different types and flavours of the mustards, vinegars and oils. Be brave and adventurous!
