                Classes in Órgiva
            </h2>

            <p>We are taking a temporary break but classes will be recommencing soon once we have our new venue ready.
                In addition, we will soon be offering half-day and full-day vinyasa flow and yin yoga workshops.</p>

            <p>To be kept up to date about new classes and workshops in Las Alpujarras we will be offering soon you can
                <a href="#" onclick="showMailingPopUp(); return false;">join our mailing list</a> and for extra updates you can also
                follow our page on Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marjariyogaspain">www.facebook.com/marjariyogaspain</a></p>

            <h3>Vinyasa Flow Yoga</h3>

            <p>This is a flowing and dynamic style of yoga where each movement is connected to the breath, a moving meditation, which can almost feel like a flowing dance. It's a beautiful style of yoga and the pace and poses can be adapted depending on the levels and needs of the students in the class. Some classes take a specific focus; for example, arm balances, heart-openers or inversions, and other classes are a mixture for working all over the body. Some classes include pranayama (breath work) before final relaxation.</p>

            <h3>Yin Yoga</h3>

            <p>The idea behind this style of yoga is to apply moderate stress to the connective tissues of the body (tendons, fascia, and ligaments), with the aim of increasing circulation in the joints and improving flexibility. Each pose is held for longer than in most other styles of yoga, and the use of props is encouraged to keep you comfortable. With so many 'Yang'-style yoga practices offered, and so much Yang energy in a lot of people's everyday lives, Yin Yoga helps to keep our Yin and Yang energy balanced. It is a more meditative approach to yoga and aims at cultivating awareness of inner silence, bringing to light a universal, interconnecting quality.</p>

            <h3>About me</h3>

            <p>I have been shown the beginning of the wonderful path of yoga by many inspiring people, but perhaps the
                most important - and least conventional - was a cat called Flo. A
                small creature who needed a safe place to live while she was pregnant and after she gave birth, I
                fostered her
                for a few months to help out a charity. But what I didn't
                expect was to create such a strong bond with this little cat; I'd never before
                experienced anything like this. She was so tiny but with the most beautiful huge eyes, and every time I
                looked into them it was like I could see the whole universe! She, to me, was my true Guru. She brought
                out the best in me, being so calm herself, even during giving birth to her six kittens! She seemed to
                embody all that is good in the world, peace, calmness, wonder, love. The bond we have, I believe, is
                true unconditional love and I will never forget what a wonderful feeling that was, to experience that
                for the first time. From this experience I know that yoga is so much more than doing poses on the mat;
                but stilling the body, which is always in the present, is a great place to start. Flo is now happily
                living with her new furrever family in Woking, UK.</p>
            <p>The sharing of yoga should be done from the heart, and that's exactly how I aim to teach every one of my
                classes. I am a 200 hour Yoga Alliance Certified yoga teacher, I trained in multistyle yoga under the
                guidance and wisdom of Guru Mahinder Prasad; <a href="http://www.siddhiyoga.com/" target="_blank">Siddhi
                    Yoga</a>,
                Dharamsala, India. My training and teaching
                styles include Vinyasa Flow, Hatha, Astanga, Yin Yoga and some therapeutical Iyengar Yoga.</p>

            <p>Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you have any questions and I look forward to seeing you
                on the mat soon!</p>

            <h3>Directions</h3>

            <p>Walk uphill up the main road past the church. Turn left down the small road next to Órgiva Properties
                (Calle Real). At the next crossroads, turn right onto Calle Libertad. Walk up
                the hill, and number 34 is the door straight ahead of you as the road turns to the left at the top of
                the hill.</p>
