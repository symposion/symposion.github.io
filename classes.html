                Classes in Órgiva
            </h2>

            <p>Classes take place every <b>Saturday morning, 10:30am - 12pm</b> in Blossom Centre, the hall to the
                right-hand side of
                restaurant Pizza 'n' Love (directions and a map can be found below).</p>

            <p>The price for the 90 minute class is <b>€5</b> per person.</p>

            <p>Classes are Vinyasa Flow Yoga style. This is a flowing and dynamic style of yoga where each movement is
                connected to the breath, a moving meditation, which can almost feel like a flowing dance. It's a really
                beautiful style of yoga and the pace and poses can be adapted depending on the levels and needs of the
                students in the class. Some classes will include pranayama (breath work).</p>

            <p>I also hope to run some Yin Yoga classes later in 2016, so watch this space!</p>

            <p>At present, I wont be taking any payment myself from running the classes. The price will cover the cost
                of the hall hire and anything I make over that will be donated to local animal charities in Las
                Alpujarras.</p>

            <p>In addition, I am seeking a fire-fighting/bomberos charity to send donations to, to give something back
                to those who risk their lives when putting out and controlling the dreadful forest fires. I would be
                keen to hear from anyone who knows of any such charity. Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a></p>

            <h3>About me</h3>

            <p>I have been shown the beginning of the wonderful path of yoga by many inspiring people, but perhaps the
                most important - and least conventional - was a cat called Flo. A
                small creature who needed a safe place to live while she was pregnant and after she gave birth, I
                fostered her
                for a few months to help out a charity. But what I didn't
                expect was to create such a strong bond with this little cat; I'd never before
                experienced anything like this. She was so tiny but with the most beautiful huge eyes, and every time I
                looked into them it was like I could see the whole universe! She, to me, was my true Guru. She brought
                out the best in me, being so calm herself, even during giving birth to her six kittens! She seemed to
                embody all that is good in the world, peace, calmness, wonder, love. The bond we have, I believe, is
                true unconditional love and I will never forget what a wonderful feeling that was, to experience that
                for the first time. From this experience I know that yoga is so much more than doing poses on the mat;
                but stilling the body, which is always in the present, is a great place to start. Flo is now happily
                living with her new furrever family in Woking, UK.</p>
            <p>The sharing of yoga should be done from the heart, and that's exactly how I aim to teach every one of my
                classes. I am a 200 hour Yoga Alliance Certified yoga teacher, I trained in multistyle yoga under the
                guidance and wisdom of Guru Mahinder Prasad; <a href="http://www.siddhiyoga.com/" target="_blank">Siddhi
                    Yoga</a>,
                Dharamsala, India. My training and teaching
                styles include Vinyasa Flow, Hatha, Astanga, Yin Yoga and some therapeutical Iyengar Yoga.</p>

            <p>Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you have any questions and I look forward to seeing you
                on the mat soon!</p>

            <h3>Directions</h3>

            <p>Walk uphill up the main road past the church. Turn left down the small road next to Órgiva Properties
                (Calle Real). At the next crossroads, turn right onto Calle Libertad. Walk up
                the hill, and number 34 is the door straight ahead of you as the road turns to the left at the top of
                the hill.</p>
